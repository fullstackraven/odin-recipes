# Recipes-Website
A beginning html website that taught me a deeper appreciation for attention to detail and never underestimating writing even simple code - oh and also its a recipe site of some of my favorites 
This recipe book written in HTML for the Odin Project; see here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes. The requirements of this project is to create a recipe index in HTML only. This project helped me learn how to use git and github, how to write HTML, how to organize directories for a webpage, and how to access files in those directories to be displayed in HTML.
